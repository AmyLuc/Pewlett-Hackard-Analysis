# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
This project is intended to identify the scope of soon-to-be retirees at Pewlett-Hackard so that an adequate number of replacements can be found in a timely manner. This may help limit any gaps during which key positions would not be filled. 

---
## Results

*	There are over 50,000 employees in total that are set to retire soon. 
*	The vast majority of which are senior staff members and senior engineers. 
*	There are only 1549 employees that are eligible for the mentorship program. 
*	Assistant Engineers have the second smallest group of retirees.

## Summary

These numbers would require each mentor to take on roughly 33 trainees. This would be feasible if there were a few years until the 'Silver Tsunami', but otherwise it would unreasonable to expect a part-time employee to train 33 people on short notice, depending on the difficulty of the job and the experience level of the new hires. 

Given the relatively small number of assistant engineering retirees, it may be worth considering to try and promote as many assistant engineers to senior engineers as possible. The people eligible for the mentorship program will likely only be able to train a fraction of the employees necessary before they themselves retire. Meanwhile, the assistant engineers likely are already familiar with the senior engineer position and would require less training than hiring new employees directly into that position. Additionally, they could be asked to train new assistant engineers before they fully make the transition to senior engineer.
